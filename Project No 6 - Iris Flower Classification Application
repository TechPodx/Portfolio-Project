## Languages

- **React** for UI
- **Python** for Machine Learning and Flask Server

## Other Resources

I used Jupyter Notebook to develop the machine learning model and VS Code for all other aspects of application development.

## How to Operate

Upon landing on the homepage, you will have space to enter flower dimensions. After pressing the "Submit" button, the user inputs are sent to the Flask server. The machine learning model then predicts the flower type, and the answer is sent back to the UI.
